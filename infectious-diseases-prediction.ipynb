These diseases significantly impact public health and the global economy, with varying incidence and prevalence across different regions and populations over time.\n\nThe dataset tracks outbreaks by year and state, detailing the location, type, duration, and demographic information of affected individuals, such as age, gender, and race. It also includes information on the suspected or confirmed pathogens, modes of transmission, and outbreak sources, covering a range of diseases like foodborne illnesses, respiratory infections, and sexually transmitted infections.\n\nDataset Features:\n*   Disease\n*   County\n*   Year\n*   Sex\n*   Count\n*   Population\n*   Rate\n*   CI.lower\n*   CI.upper\n*   Unstable","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}}]}
